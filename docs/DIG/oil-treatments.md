Wood oils using UV LED technology are available in the Netherlands from companies like
Vesting HQ B.V.. This technology uses UV LED light to instantly cure the oil, allowing for faster application and project completion compared to traditional drying methods. The finish penetrates the wood, enhances its natural look, and offers durability. 
Key benefits of UV LED wood oils

    Instant curing: The finish hardens almost immediately when exposed to UV LED light, significantly reducing wait and project times.
    Enhanced natural look: These oils impregnate the wood fibers, preserving the natural look and feel of the wood while providing protection.
    Durability: They are formulated to provide a durable and hard-wearing finish resistant to scratches, stains, and other environmental factors.
    Environmentally friendly: Many formulations are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and safer for indoor use, aligning with sustainability goals. 

Application process

    Sanding is a crucial first step, often to around 120 grit, to prepare the wood.
    The oil is applied to the surface.
    It is then cured with a UV LED light source.
    Depending on the desired result, a light scuff sanding may be performed between coats before the next one is applied and cured.
    Excess oil is wiped off with a paper towel after about 20 minutes to prevent it from drying on the surface, notes De Houtdraaierij and Vesting HQ B.V..

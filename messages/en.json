            "content": "Glue-Down Vinyl flooring, also known as Dryback vinyl, represents the premium standard for permanent floor installations in commercial and high-traffic environments. Manufactured by Floer in the Netherlands, these professional-grade floors are adhered directly to the subfloor using specialized vinyl adhesive, creating an exceptionally stable and durable surface that won't shift, move, or develop gaps over time. This permanent installation method provides superior stability compared to floating floors, making it the preferred choice for commercial spaces, retail environments, offices, and homes where maximum durability is essential. With 100% waterproof construction, phthalate-free materials using bio-organic plasticizers, and REACH, FloorScore, and GreenGuard certifications, these floors meet the highest safety and environmental standards. The collection includes five distinct styles ranging from 2mm to 5mm thickness: large-format Tile Vinyl for contemporary aesthetics, elegant Herringbone patterns with ceramic bead wear layer, Nature Rigid with reinforced core for extreme durability, Village Vinyl with authentic oak realism, and Forest Vinyl with extra-wide luxury planks.

## Overview

Implement Firebase backend services to power the EcoVibeFloors luxury flooring import platform, providing robust data management, authentication, and file storage capabilities for the Bulgarian market with bilingual support. The integration will enable secure product catalog management, user authentication, and high-quality image storage for premium Dutch flooring materials.

## User Stories

**US-1: Admin Authentication**
As a platform administrator, I want to securely authenticate using Firebase Auth so that I can manage the luxury flooring product catalog and customer inquiries with proper access controls.

**US-2: Product Data Management**
As a content manager, I want to store and retrieve bilingual product information (English/Bulgarian) in Firestore so that I can maintain accurate pricing, specifications, and descriptions for premium Dutch flooring materials.

**US-3: File Storage for Luxury Assets**
As a marketing manager, I want to upload and serve high-resolution product images and documents through Firebase Storage so that customers can view detailed visualizations of luxury flooring options with fast loading times.

## Spec Scope

## Out of Scope

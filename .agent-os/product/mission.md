## The Problem

### Limited Premium Flooring Access
Bulgarian market lacks access to authentic Dutch premium flooring systems with proven quality and extended guarantees. Most available options are either lower quality or lack proper warranty support.

**Our Solution:** Direct import partnership with Dutch manufacturers providing authentic premium flooring with full warranty support.

Consumers struggle with language barriers and trust issues when dealing with international flooring suppliers, leading to hesitation in premium purchases.

**Our Solution:** Local Bulgarian expertise combined with Dutch quality, providing bilingual support and local warranty service.

### Professional Network Gap
Interior designers and contractors lack access to exclusive premium flooring options and commission-based partnerships that enhance their service offerings.

**Our Solution:** B2B partnership program with commission structure and professional support for design professionals.
